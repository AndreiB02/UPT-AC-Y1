/*
6. Write a function returning the minimum of all values produced 
by repeated application of rotswap() to a 32-bit unsigned value. 
rotswap computes a value as follows: rotate left by 4 bits 
(leftmost bits are inserted rightmost), then swap the two 16-bit halves.

abcdef12
bcdef12a rotate
f12abcde swap

12abcdef rotate
cdef12ab swap

def12abc rotate
2abcdef1 swap

abcdef12 rotate
