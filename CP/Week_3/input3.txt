2. Paragraph info Write a program that reads all input and prints, for each paragraph, the number of words and lines. A paragraph is a portion of text that does not start with a newline, ends with a single newline or EOF and is separated by at least one newline from other paragraphs.
3. Fixed-width printing Write a function that takes an unsigned n as a parameter, and prints a text read until the end of input, fitting n characters per line. Words(sequences of non-whitespace chars) are printed with one space in between. A word that would exceed the line limit will be split inserting a hyphen ('-') as the last character on the line (no extra hyphen is needed if the last character that fits is a hyphen itself). Newlines in the original text are observed. Hint: to handle the end of the line, write a function peek() which returns the next character without consuming it (use ungetc()).
